# Project Overview

This project is a Chatbot powered by LangGraph workflows and large language models. The chatbot is capable of:

ðŸ’¬ Answering user questions in natural language.

ðŸ“‚ Uploading and processing PDF documents, allowing users to ask questions based on the content of the uploaded PDF.

ðŸ§  Using LangGraph agents to manage workflows and retrieve context-aware answers.

Currently, the chatbot integrates an OpenAI 120B parameter model. While this model does not provide real-time answers from the internet, it excels at understanding text, reasoning, and generating responses based on the provided context (such as your uploaded documents).

âœ¨ Key Features

Question answering on both general queries and document-specific queries.

Context retrieval from PDFs for accurate and relevant answers.

Modular LangGraph-based design, making it easy to extend with new tools and agents.

Streamlit-based frontend for a simple and interactive user experience.
